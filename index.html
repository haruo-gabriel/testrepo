        <h1>learning github</h1>

        <p>I've already cloned the repo in my machine, and now I'm creating this html file on it.</p>

        <p>Kinda boring to learn about ssh and authentication, but it'll be useful in the future.</p>

        <p>Finally, an error has appeared, and fortunately it's an easy one to repair.</p>

        <p>I did it! I managed to make a pull from my local machine to github!</p>

        <p>Now, I'm learning about branching.</p>

        <p>I tried to mess up with another repo on my local machine, but it went all wrong. Lots of errors I couldn't fix, and I simply dropped it.</p>

        <p>Time to go back to this repo.</p>
